# Admission-Prediction-Application


Objective:
    With the help of Logistic Regression we can determine 
    whether a person can admit or not by given gre, gpa & rank.

HERE WE HAVE:
1. data file   (LR-1 for model making) and (LR-2 just another data for testing).
2. model.py: here we have trained our data using Logistic Regression.
3. model.pkl is the pickle file of our model which we can be used next.
4. index.html and predict.html inside templates.zip.
5. flaskapp.py is our app that we deploying.
