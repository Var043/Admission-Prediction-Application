# Admission-Prediction-Application


Objective:
    With the help of Logistic Regression we can determine 
    whether a person can admit or not by given gre, gpa & rank.

HERE WE HAVE:
1. Refrence Data Files  (LR-1 for model making) and (LR-2 just another data for testing).
2. model.py: here we have trained our data using Logistic Regression.
3. model.pkl is the pickle file of our model which we can be used next.
4. flaskapp.py is our app that we deploying.
5. Index.html and Predict.html inside templates.zip.
6. Data.txt for storing the new data providing by the user.
